# JobCrawler
Html crawler for simplified job search by skills

To get the code working, you need to make sure you have the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries installed. You can install them with the pip install requests beautifulsoup4 command.
You also need to update the job_sites list with the URLs of the actual job board sites you want to pull data from.
The code creates a CSV file named "job_listings.csv" in the same directory as the Python script. The extracted job listings are stored in this file. You can open the file and check the results.
